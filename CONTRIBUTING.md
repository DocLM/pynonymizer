# Contributing

We love contributions!

## Issue Tracker
Discuss the change using the issue tracker - create an issue for a bug, feature request or discussion.

Ideally, there should be some discussion before a change, so get into the habit of creating the issue first.
Try to provide as much useful or relevant information as possible so as to improve the project for everyone.

### Labels
We use the [robinpowered](https://robinpowered.com/blog/best-practice-system-for-organizing-and-tagging-github-issues/) label style guide where possible.
There are a set of labels you can use which should cover most situations. What's important is the colours remain fairly consistent.

If you don't see the label you think you need, open an issue!

## Merge Requests

Create a merge request based on the issue, targeting the default branch. You can use the "Create merge request" button in Gitlab, 
this will make a Work in Progress (`WIP`) branch in the form:
```
000-name-of-issue
```

Complete your work, adding tests for your changes.

When you've completed your work, and it's ready to be merged, unmark your request as `WIP`.

At this point you're waiting on the maintainers. They might suggest an improvement or provide feedback.

Once everyone's happy the request will be merged.

Some things that will increase the chance that your merge request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write good [commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
