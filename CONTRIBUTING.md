# Contributing

1. Fork it (https://github.com/jerometwell/pynonymizer/fork)
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')
4. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
5. Create a new Pull Request

At this point you're waiting on the maintainers. They might suggest an improvement or provide feedback.

Once everyone's happy the request will be merged.

Some things that will increase the chance that your merge request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write good [commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)


## Issues

Ideally, there should be some discussion before a change, so get into the habit of creating the issue first.
Try to provide as much useful or relevant information as possible so as to improve the project for everyone.
