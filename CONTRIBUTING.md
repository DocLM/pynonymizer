# Contributing

1. Fork it (https://github.com/jerometwell/pynonymizer/fork)
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')
4. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
5. Create a new Pull Request

At this point you're waiting on the maintainers. They might suggest an improvement or provide feedback.

Once everyone's happy the request will be merged.

Some things that will increase the chance that your merge request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write good [commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* Add an entry to the `CHANGELOG.md` file, under the `[Unreleased]` section. If you're unsure why this is important, check out [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the intended release process.
  
  Try to describe what you've achieved from a user-facing perspective. 

## Issues

In an ideal world, changes come with discussion, so for general points and structural changes an issue might be more productive.
Try to provide as much useful or relevant information as possible so as to improve the project for everyone.
