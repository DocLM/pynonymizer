# Contributing

We love merge requests! 

Discuss the change using the issue tracker - create an issue for a bug, feature request or discussion.

Create a merge request based on the issue, targetting `develop`.
Set your merge request as Work In Progress (WIP:).

Complete your work, adding tests for your changes. Then make sure the tests pass:
```
    tox
```

Push to your branch and unmark the merge request as WIP.

At this point you're waiting on the maintainers. They might suggest an improvement or provide feedback.

If the maintainer approves the request will be merged.

Some things that will increase the chance that your merge request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write good [commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
